# 🌱 Valence  
**Green Hydrogen Infrastructure Mapping and Optimization**

---

## 📌 Overview  
Valence is a map-based tool designed to help **urban planners, energy companies, project developers, and policy analysts** identify optimal locations for growing the hydrogen ecosystem.  

The application visualizes **existing and planned hydrogen assets** (plants, storage facilities, pipelines, distribution hubs) and integrates data-driven models to recommend new project sites.  

By combining **geospatial visualization with renewable energy data and optimization algorithms**, Valence guides investment decisions that support sustainable hydrogen infrastructure development.

## ✨ Features  

- 🗺️ **Interactive Map** – Visualize hydrogen plants, pipelines, storage hubs, and demand centers.  
- ⚡ **Data Integration** – Overlay renewable energy sources, transport logistics, and market demand.  
- 📊 **Optimization Engine** – Recommend new sites based on:  
  - Proximity to renewable generation  
  - Market demand  
  - Regulatory constraints  
  - Cost optimization  
- 📂 **Data Input** – Ingest CSV datasets for infrastructure and renewable energy.  
- 🔍 **Filtering & Search** – Explore assets by type, region, or development stage.  
- 📡 **Scalable Backend** – Built with Node.js & Express.js for API handling.  
- ☁️ **Database** – MongoDB Atlas stores asset and configuration data.
